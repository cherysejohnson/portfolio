# Portfolio
Portfolio is a project and online resume.

# Details
My portfolio is intended to provide relevant information about myself and my skills. My portfolio is also meant to showcase my abilties as a designer and developer. My brand of design and what I have to offer is unique, and my personal project 'Portfolio' was created to show that.

Portfolio utilizes HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a beautifully responsive website. There is a dark-mode, light-mode, scroll-reveal, and other cool features. Feel free to click around and enjoy.
